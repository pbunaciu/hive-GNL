 ##     DESCRIPTION
 > Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
 Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to your get_next_line() function should let
you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
Your function should return the line that was read.
If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
 
 ## External functions
 read, malloc, free
